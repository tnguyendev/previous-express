# To Do List

This is a To Do list application that allows users to add tasks that they need to complete to a list. The tasks will then show up on the list, and users call click on the check mark to strikethrough and mark the item as completed. Users are also able to clear out completed tasks and leave the incomplete ones still in the list.

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

## Thoughts:

This was interesting to work with! You had to sort of rethink the way you made the initial project so that it now fits with a new framework. You feel sort of lost at first, but after the initial run through it makes a bit more sense. As a side note, I'm pretty proud of the css on this. It's one of those "simple but cute" projects. Really like how it turned out!
